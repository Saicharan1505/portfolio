      <p class="intro">
        👋 Hi, I’m Saicharan. I’m a full-stack developer with over 7 years of
        experience designing and building production-grade web applications and
        scalable systems used in real-world environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience spans frontend engineering, backend services, and cloud
        deployments. I work primarily with Angular, TypeScript, and Node.js to
        build clean interfaces, secure APIs, and real-time features that perform
        well under real production traffic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve worked on platforms ranging from enterprise finance systems to live
        auction and scheduling applications, where performance, consistency, and
        maintainability are critical. I enjoy understanding how systems behave
        under load and refining them to be faster, simpler, and easier to extend.
      </p>

      <h3>What I work with</h3>

  <ul class="highlights">
    <li>
      Angular applications using modern patterns (RxJS, Signals, Reactive Forms,
      Angular Material)
    </li>
    <li>
      Backend services and APIs built with Node.js, Express, and NestJS, with
      authentication and role-based access
    </li>
    <li>
      Responsive, accessible layouts using HTML, CSS, and component-driven
      design
    </li>
    <li>
      Real-time data flows using WebSockets and Redis for ordering and
      concurrency control
    </li>
    <li>
      Cloud deployments and CI/CD workflows using AWS, Docker, and Jenkins
    </li>
    <li>
      Performance analysis and debugging using browser and application-level
      profiling tools
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="closing">
    Outside of work, I like exploring new frontend and system-design ideas,
    revisiting fundamentals, and building small projects to experiment with
    better patterns and performance improvements.
